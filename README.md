# SciWorCS
A number of Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) have been proposed and developed in recent years to facilitate the scientific experiments. For example some of the popular SWfMSs are: Taverna, Galaxy, Kepler, Pegasus, VisTrails, Triana, VIEW. The existing SWfMSs support only single user for a given data analysis process, however, modern scientific research projects are often collaborative in nature --involving multiple researchers of diverse domain and expertise. SciWorCS is a Collaborative Scientific Workflow management System. SciWorCS follows a plugin-based architecture for the scientific computational modules. It provides collaborative environment for scientific data analysis using efficient attribute level locking scheme. In addition to the collaborative data analysis, SciWorCS also provides real time monitoring of the computation steps.

The above figure shows a screenshot of the SciWorCS workflow editor UI. The panel labeled as \lq A', contains all the workflow components such as, \textit{Toolbox} (i.e., set of workflow modules), \textit{Saved Workflows} and \textit{Shared Workflows} with other users. The set of modules are classified in different Toolbox based on the general data analysis purposes of the computational modules. Some examples of such Toolboxes are: \textit{Bioinformatics}, \textit{Machine Learning}, \textit{Source Analysis} and so on as illustrated in the figure.\\
\indent The collaborative composition of the workflow is done on panel \lq B'. For the intended data analysis task, the required modules are selected (e.g., via \textit{Left-Mouse Click}) from the corresponding Toolbox to appear in the composition panel. The selected modules are then connected together (via., \textit{Left-Mouse Click \& Drag}) on the corresponding input/output ports for defining the datalink relation among the modules. Please note that, the linking requires a matching data types (e.g., a \textit{.txt} output port connects only with another \textit{.txt} input port) between the input/output ports. The modules can be configured with corresponding attributes from panel \lq C'. Panel \lq D' shows a list of collaborators and their current online/offline status. The list of the workflow outputs are shown in panel \lq E'. New dataset can be browsed and uploaded to the central server for analysis from the panel \lq F'.
